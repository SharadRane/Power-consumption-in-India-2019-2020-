# Power-consumption-in-India-2019-2020-

India is the world's third-largest producer and third-largest consumer of electricity.
In light of the recent COVID-19 situation, when everyone has been under lockdown for the months of April & May the impacts of the lockdown on economic activities 
have been faced by every sector in a positive or a negative way.
With the electricity consumption being so crucial to the country, we came up with a plan to study the impact on energy consumption state and region wise.
The aim of the project is to analyze the energy consumption state wise in year 2019 - 2020
